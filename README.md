# Vision Mabma

## About

This is my attempt at an implementation of vision mamba (ViM) as outlined in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09417. The code for the vision mamba encoder blocks can be found under `src/VisionMambaEncoder.py`.

## TODO

- [X] Create the basic architecture from the cited paper
- [ ] Debug the backward and forward processes
- [ ] Finish Training on CIFAR10
- [ ] Larger scale training on ImageNet
- [ ] Adjust to Image-Text model
